## Restaurant Roulette : Write/Speak/Code Node.js Workshop

### Environment Setup

Please do steps 1-3 before the workshop! It will let us dive right in and get the most out of the time we have. 

Disclaimer: I will be running the workshop on a Mac. I've linked resources below for Mac, Windows, and Linux, 
but I can't speak to how thorough the Windows/Linux resources are. Please seek out other resources if 
you run into trouble!

1) Install Node and npm. Here are guides for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

2) Have a Text Editor / IDE ready. I will be doing the workshop in Visual Studio Code, but feel free to use your favorite editor. Here are some good options if you need to download one:

* Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
* Atom: https://atom.io/
* Sublime: https://www.sublimetext.com/

3. Set up git if you don't have it set up: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
